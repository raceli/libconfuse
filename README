This is a confuse fork of libConfuse, a great library to parse configuration
files. The original project can be found on http://sv.nongnu.org/projects/confuse.

I am actually confused whenever I want to have configuration files that are easy
to read and modify. INI files are too basic, YAML becomes too weird...

I wanted someone simple, yet powerful, in C so I can write bindings on top and
with CMake so I can make cross-IDE builds. The original libconfuse project
fits perfectly. The fork is not a huge thing though, mostly CMakized and 
create python bindings.
